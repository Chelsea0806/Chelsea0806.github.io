## Background
The NHM Images[https://www.nhmimages.com/en/news/show_news_list_page.html] has their latest and noteworthy curated image collections, which includes a variety of types, for example, portrait, history, animals and nature.

## Layout
At first, choose a category at random. Then you can see, at the top, there is a row of fliters, so that images can be presented in the way you want them to be. 
If you want to take a closer look at one of the images you are most interested in, click on the image and you will see the image ID, the title and photographer 
of the image, the source of the image and the option to print the image or not. In certain history and people themed modules, you will find a short introduction 
below the picture.

## User experience
This type of collection is beneficial for those who love flora, fauna, historyï¼Œfigures and other subjects for study and appreciation. However, this digital image 
collection would be better if it could classify the subject matter of the images.

## Filter functionality
To be precise, this is not called filter. It is more of a way of choosing the presentation of the images. For example, you can choose the size of the image to 
be displayed and, if you want to see more images at once, conversely, you can choose a larger image. Another example is that you can choose whether to hide the 
staple caption below the image.

## Categories
This image archive can be categorised by the subject of the image, or by the chronological order of updates.
