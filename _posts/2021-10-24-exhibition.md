This exhibition is from an artist of Indian origin called Anish Kapoor.
Through painting, Kapoor delves into the deep inner world of our mind and body, from the physical exploration of the flesh and blood, to investigating psychological concepts as primal and nameless as origin and obliteration.

Made of metal and resin, this work is very realistic with clear textures of blood when viewed up close. 
Personally, it can be imagined as thousands of people fighting and killing each other to reach the top.
