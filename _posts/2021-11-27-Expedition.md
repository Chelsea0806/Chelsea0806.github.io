## Question One
### What kinds of research could people do using the information in Hansard as a resource?
The Hansard is essentially a verbatim report which records in the first person what has been said in both Houses of Parliament and also includes questions about notices answered on the day of the sitting. The webpage divides the Hansard into two sections, House of Commons Hansard and House of Lords Hansard. Each section is divided into four parts: Parliamentary Topics, Contents of Parliamentary Debates, Parliamentary Voting Results and Information for Members of Parliament. In addition, one can search by keywords or the names of the members. 
I believe that people can search the Hansard for information that interests them or is relevant to their interests, find the latest legislation on the matter, answers to relevant questions and solutions, and defend their rights reasonably if it involves a conflict with the interests of most people. Secondly, people can actually pay attention to the MP who has an interest in them and what she has to say.

## Question Two
### How well does the Hansard website facilitate those kinds of research?
Firstly, the Hansard provides a clear report by correcting obvious errors and selectively removing redundancies and unnecessary repetitions on the basis of a verbatim record of what was said. 
Secondly, the Hansard presents the latest parliamentary session separately and provides four other search methods, as I mentioned in Question One. This categorisation better helps people to search and navigate through the parliamentary content. 
Thirdly, Hansard is a project that is still a work in progress. Although the site was only launched in 2010, it was designed to be a more complete database of parliamentary records dating back to as early as the early 19th century before 2010, which are uploaded to the site in scanned form.
